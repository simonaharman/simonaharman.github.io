title: About Me & Works
---

Hey, I'm Simon, Founder and CEO of the [Loki Project](https://loki.network), and I sit on the board of the the [Loki Foundation](loki.foundation). The Loki team and I have produced several products, including:

* [Session](https://getsession.org), a secure messaging app based on the Signal protocol that has no phone numbers, central servers, and onion routes messages over the Loki network.
* [Blockswap](https://blockswap.to), a cross-chain liqudity tool designed to connect other blockchains to the ethereum DeFi ecosystem that also features privacy through the Loki blockchain

I'm a passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast, as well as a strong advocate for digital privacy, but in particular, my specialty lies within the nascent and arguably non-existant field of cryptoeconomics. The world is in a great period of economic transition, where neoliberal economics appears to be making way for newer ideas around monetry policty and fiscal measures, while at the same time, crypto and DeFi present some of the most interesting opportunites for experimentation with economic ideas. 

## Works

Some of the larger papers I've written contributed to are:

* 2020 - [LRC-7](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-improvement-proposals/issues/24) - an analysis of Blockswap's economic implications for Loki and recommendations to address them 
* 2020 - [LRC-3](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-improvement-proposals/files/3843874/LokiEmissionsSchemeReview2019.pdf) - the second analysis of the Loki network's economic scheme in light of Proof of Stake 
* 2019 - [Session Whitepaper](https://getsession.org/whitepaper) - Our secure messaging app's primary design document 
* 2018 - [Loki Cryptoeconomics](https://loki.network/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Loki_Cryptoeconomics-2-1.pdf) - a preliminary design for Service Nodes 
* 2018 - [Loki Whitepaper](https://loki.network/whitepaper) - The founding document for the Loki Project
